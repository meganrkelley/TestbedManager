----- 6. Common Problems and Solutions -----

	Problem: WMI connection problems
	Solution: First, you must be able to communicate with the remote machine over your network.
	Second, make sure that the username and password provided are correct.
	If the connection and credentials are okay, then visit http://www.poweradmin.com/help/enablewmi.aspx.

	Problem: Not getting output from shell commands
	Solution: Make sure the user provided has permission to write to the \\machineName\C$ directory. If a login prompt is not provided, run "rundll32.exe keymgr.dll, KRShowKeyMgr" and add the computer, username, and password and try again.

	Problem: Scheduled tasks returns nothing, but I have tasks.
	Solution: This function can only return jobs that are created using either a script or AT.exe. It cannot return information about jobs that are either created by or modified by the Scheduled Task wizard.

	All other problems should be reported as bugs to the application developer: please attach the relevant log text files, which can be accessed from "HELP -> Open Logs Folder" and e-mail them to meganrkelley@gmail.com.
